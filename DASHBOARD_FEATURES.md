# 🛡️ SafeZoneX Enhanced Security Dashboard - Feature Documentation

## 🎉 New Features Overview

The security dashboard has been **completely redesigned** with powerful new features for comprehensive campus safety monitoring!

---

## 📊 Features Implemented

### 1. ✅ Mark as Resolved (Report Disappears)

**How it works:**
- Click "✅ Mark Resolved" button on any report
- Confirmation dialog appears
- Report slides out with animation
- Report is marked as `status: 'resolved'` in database
- Dashboard automatically filters out resolved reports
- Stats update in real-time

**Backend Change:**
- `GET /api/reports` now **excludes** `status: 'resolved'` and `status: 'false_alarm'`
- Resolved reports are permanently archived

**Code Location:**
- Frontend: `dashboard_enhanced.html` - `markAsResolved()` function
- Backend: `server.js` - Line 295 (updated query filter)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Dashboard shows "Loading reports..."
**Solution:** Check backend is running on port 8080

### Issue: Heatmap not displaying
**Solution:** Ensure Leaflet.js CDN is accessible, check browser console

### Issue: SOS alerts not appearing
**Solution:** 
- Verify Socket.IO connection (check console for "✅ Connected")
- Ensure mobile app is emitting to correct Socket.IO server
- Check backend logs for `🆘 SOS Alert received`

### Issue: Map markers not showing
**Solution:** Verify reports have valid `location.latitude` and `location.longitude`

### Issue: "Mark Resolved" not working
**Solution:** Check MongoDB connection, verify backend endpoint is responding
