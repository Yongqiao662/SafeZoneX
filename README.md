## üîß Detailed Setup Instructions

### üó∫Ô∏è **Google Maps API Setup** (Required)

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: This step is required for the app to work properly**

#### Step 1: Get Your API Key
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing one
3. Enable these APIs:
   ```
   ‚úì Maps SDK for Android
   ‚úì Maps SDK for iOS
   ‚úì Geocoding API
   ‚úì Directions API
   ‚úì Places API (optional)
   ```
4. Go to "Credentials" ‚Üí "Create Credentials" ‚Üí "API Key"
5. Copy your API key (starts with `AIza...`)

#### Step 2: Add API Key to Project
1. Navigate to the Android configuration:
   ```bash
   cd SafeZoneX/frontend/mobile/android
   ```

2. Copy the example file:
   ```bash
   cp local.properties.example local.properties
   ```

3. Edit `local.properties` and replace the placeholder:
   ```properties
   GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

4. **NEVER commit this file to git** - it contains your secret API key!

#### Step 3: Secure Your API Key
1. In Google Cloud Console ‚Üí Credentials
2. Click on your API key to edit it
3. Set "Application restrictions" ‚Üí "Android apps"
4. Add your app's SHA-1 fingerprint:
   ```bash
   # Get SHA-1 fingerprint
   keytool -list -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android
   ```

#### Step 4: For iOS (Optional)
If you plan to build for iOS, add your API key to `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift`:
```swift
GMSServices.provideAPIKey("YOUR_API_KEY_HERE")
```

### üìÅ **Local Properties Configuration** (Critical Setup)

The `local.properties` file contains essential configuration for Android builds and Google Maps integration. This file is **required** for the app to compile and function properly.

#### Step 1: Create local.properties File
```bash
cd SafeZoneX/frontend/mobile/android
cp local.properties.example local.properties
```

#### Step 2: Configure Required Properties
Edit the `local.properties` file with your system-specific paths and API key:

```properties
# Android SDK path (required for compilation)
sdk.dir=C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\sdk

# Flutter SDK path (must match your Flutter installation)
flutter.sdk=C:\\flutter

# Build configuration
flutter.buildMode=debug
flutter.versionName=1.0.0
flutter.versionCode=1

# Google Maps API Key (REQUIRED - replace with your actual key)
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=''
```

#### Step 3: Find Your SDK Paths

**For Android SDK:**
- **Windows**: `C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Local\Android\sdk`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Android/sdk`
- **Linux**: `~/Android/Sdk`

**For Flutter SDK:**
- **Recommended**: Download and extract to `C:\flutter` from https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows
- **Windows (typical)**: `C:\flutter`
- **Alternative locations**: `C:\src\flutter`
- **macOS**: `/usr/local/flutter` or `~/flutter`
- **Linux**: `/usr/local/flutter` or `~/flutter`
- **‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT** install Flutter inside project folders

#### Step 4: Proper Flutter Installation
If you haven't installed Flutter properly:

1. **Download Flutter SDK:**
   ```bash
   # Download from: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows
   # Extract the ZIP file to C:\flutter (NOT inside any project folder)
   ```

2. **Add to System PATH (Optional but recommended):**
   - Search "Environment Variables" in Windows
   - Edit system PATH variable
   - Add: `C:\flutter\bin`

3. **Verify Installation:**
   ```bash
   C:\flutter\bin\flutter --version
   C:\flutter\bin\flutter doctor
   ```

#### Step 5: Verify Configuration
Run these commands to verify everything is set up correctly:

```bash
# Check Flutter configuration
C:\flutter\bin\flutter doctor

# Navigate to project directory
cd SafeZoneX/frontend/mobile

# Verify dependencies
C:\flutter\bin\flutter pub get

# Test compilation
C:\flutter\bin\flutter build apk --debug
```

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes:**

1. **Never commit `local.properties` to version control** - it contains sensitive information
2. **Use double backslashes** (`\\`) in Windows paths
3. **Replace placeholder API key** with your actual Google Maps API key
4. **Ensure paths exist** on your system before running the app
5. **Flutter must be in a system location** - NOT inside project folders

#### üîß **Troubleshooting:**

**If you see "Target file not found" errors:**
- Verify your Flutter SDK path is correct in `local.properties`
- Ensure Flutter is installed at `C:\flutter`, not inside a project folder
- Run `C:\flutter\bin\flutter clean` and `C:\flutter\bin\flutter pub get`

**If you see "flutter.sdk=E:\AngelGuide\..." path:**
- This indicates Flutter is incorrectly installed inside another project
- Download proper Flutter installation and extract to `C:\flutter`
- Update `local.properties` with `flutter.sdk=C:\\flutter`

**If Google Maps doesn't load or shows blank with Google logo:**
- Check your Google Maps API key is valid and properly formatted
- Ensure Maps SDK for Android is enabled in Google Cloud Console
- Verify your API key has no restrictions that block your app
- Add your app's package name and SHA-1 fingerprint to API key restrictions

**If map markers/pins don't appear:**
- Ensure Flutter SDK path is correct (common cause of missing markers)
- Check console for marker creation debug messages
- Verify location permissions are granted

**If you see "ImageReader_JNI" warnings:**
- These are harmless warnings related to camera/image processing
- App functionality is not affected
- Warnings may appear when using Google Maps or camera features

**If compilation fails:**
- Update Android SDK path to match your installation
- Ensure all required dependencies are installed

#### Step 5: Location Configuration (Important)
The app currently uses demo coordinates for testing. For production:
1. Update campus location coordinates in `lib/screens/walk_with_me.dart`
2. Replace demo coordinates with your actual campus coordinates
3. Configure campus buildings and landmarks
4. Test location services work correctly in your area
