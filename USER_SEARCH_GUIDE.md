# User Search System - How It Works 🔍

## Overview
SafeZoneX uses a **secure, registration-based** friend search system. This means users must be registered in the app before they can be found by others.

---

## How The Search Works

### Current Flow (Secure & Standard) ✅

```
Step 1: User A registers in SafeZoneX
   ↓
   • Creates account with email, name, student ID
   • User data saved to MongoDB 'users' collection
   • User A is now SEARCHABLE
   
Step 2: User B searches for User A
   ↓
   • User B types "userA@university.edu" in search
   • Backend queries MongoDB for matching emails
   • User A appears in search results ✅
   
Step 3: User B adds User A as friend
   ↓
   • Friend relationship saved to MongoDB
   • Both users can now see each other in friends list
   • Can start chatting
```

### Why This Approach?

✅ **Security**: Only verified, registered users can be added  
✅ **Privacy**: Users control when they become discoverable  
✅ **Standard Practice**: Same as WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook  
✅ **Data Integrity**: All users have complete profile information  
✅ **Accountability**: All users are verified university students

## For Your Team to Test

### Setup Steps:

#### 1. **Each teammate must register individually**
```dart
// When app first runs:
1. Open SafeZoneX app
2. Complete registration:
   - Enter university email (e.g., john@university.edu)
   - Enter name (e.g., "John Doe")
   - Enter student ID
   - Complete face verification
   - Verify email with OTP code
3. ✅ Now you're searchable!
```

#### 2. **After everyone registers, you can search each other**
```dart
User Flow:
1. Go to "Friends" tab
2. Tap search icon
3. Type teammate's email (e.g., "jane@university.edu")
4. See their profile in results
5. Tap "Add Friend"
6. ✅ Friend added!
```

#### 3. **What happens if you search too early?**
```
Scenario: User B searches for User A who hasn't registered yet

Search: "userA@university.edu"
Result: ⚠️ No users found

Solution: User A must complete registration first
Then: User B can search again and find User A ✅
```

## Testing Workflow for Your Hackathon Team

### Day 1: Everyone Registers
```
Teammate 1: alice@university.edu → Registers ✅
Teammate 2: bob@university.edu → Registers ✅
Teammate 3: charlie@university.edu → Registers ✅
Teammate 4: diana@university.edu → Registers ✅
```

### Day 2: Add Each Other as Friends
```
Alice searches: "bob@university.edu" → Found! → Add Friend ✅
Bob searches: "charlie@university.edu" → Found! → Add Friend ✅
Charlie searches: "diana@university.edu" → Found! → Add Friend ✅
Diana searches: "alice@university.edu" → Found! → Add Friend ✅
```

### Day 3: Test Features Together
```
✅ Share live location with friends
✅ Send/receive chat messages
✅ Test SOS alerts to friends
✅ Test safety reports
✅ Test walk together feature
```

## Technical Details

### Backend Search Endpoint
```javascript
// File: backend/server.js
app.get('/api/users/search', async (req, res) => {
  const { email, currentUserId } = req.query;
  
  // Search MongoDB users collection
  const users = await User.find({ 
    email: { $regex: email, $options: 'i' }, // Case-insensitive partial match
    userId: { $ne: currentUserId } // Exclude yourself
  }).limit(10);
  
  res.json({ success: true, users });
});
```

### What Gets Searched:
- **Email address** (primary search field)
- **Case-insensitive** (ALICE@uni.edu = alice@uni.edu)
- **Partial match** (searching "alice" finds "alice@university.edu")
- **Excludes yourself** (won't find your own account)
- **Limit 10 results** (prevents spam)

### User Data Returned:
```javascript
{
  userId: "unique_id_123",
  name: "Alice Johnson",
  email: "alice@university.edu",
  profilePicture: "base64_string_or_url"
}
```

## Common Questions

### Q: Can I search for someone who hasn't registered?
**A:** No. Users must register first to be searchable. This ensures:
- Only verified university students are in the system
- All users have completed identity verification
- Privacy and security are maintained

### Q: Can I search by name instead of email?
**A:** Currently, search is email-based. This prevents:
- Duplicate names causing confusion
- Random people finding you by guessing names
- Ensures you're adding the correct person

### Q: What if I can't find my teammate?
**A:** Check these steps:
1. ✅ Has your teammate completed registration?
2. ✅ Are you typing the correct email?
3. ✅ Is the backend server running?
4. ✅ Is your app connected to the backend?

### Q: Can people outside my university find me?
**A:** Only users with your exact email address can find you. The search requires typing the email, so random users cannot browse or discover you.

## Backend Requirements

### MongoDB Collections Used:
```javascript
1. users - Stores all registered user profiles
   • email (indexed for fast search)
   • name, studentId, profilePicture
   • Registration timestamp

2. friends - Stores friend relationships
   • userId ↔ friendId (bidirectional)
   • status: accepted, pending, blocked

3. messages - Stores chat history
   • senderId → recipientId
   • Only between friends
```

### Environment Setup:
```bash
# Backend must be running
cd backend
node server.js

# Expected output:
# 📦 Connected to MongoDB successfully
# 🚀 Server running on port 8080
```

---

## Security Features

### 1. **No Public User Directory**
- Cannot browse all users
- Cannot see random profiles
- Must know exact email to search

### 2. **Authentication Required**
- Must be logged in to search
- Cannot search without valid userId
- Each request is user-specific

### 3. **Rate Limiting** (TODO)
- Prevent spam searches
- Max 10 results per query
- Consider adding rate limits in production

### 4. **Data Privacy**
- Search excludes sensitive data
- Only returns: name, email, profile picture
- Does not expose: phone, address, location

## Comparison with Other Apps

| App | Search Method | Registration Required |
|-----|--------------|---------------------|
| **SafeZoneX** | Email | ✅ Yes |
| WhatsApp | Phone Number | ✅ Yes |
| Instagram | Username | ✅ Yes |
| Facebook | Email/Name | ✅ Yes |
| LinkedIn | Name/Email | ✅ Yes |
| Telegram | Phone/Username | ✅ Yes |

**All major social apps require registration before users become searchable.** ✅

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

### Possible additions:
1. **Search by Student ID**
   - Add `studentId` to search query
   - Useful for university context

2. **Search by Name**
   - Add name-based search
   - Requires disambiguation (multiple John Does)

3. **Friend Suggestions**
   - Recommend friends of friends
   - Based on shared classes/locations

4. **QR Code Friend Add**
   - Generate personal QR code
   - Scan to add without typing email

5. **Nearby Users** (Location-based)
   - Find users in same campus area
   - Opt-in feature for safety

---

## Summary

✅ **Current System**: Secure, registration-based search  
✅ **Best For**: University safety app with verified users  
✅ **Team Workflow**: Everyone registers → Then add each other  
✅ **Security**: Only known emails can be found  
✅ **Standard**: Same as WhatsApp, Instagram, etc.

### For Your Hackathon Demo:
1. Have all team members register beforehand
2. Test adding each other as friends
3. Demo the friend features (chat, location, SOS)
4. Explain the security benefits to judges
